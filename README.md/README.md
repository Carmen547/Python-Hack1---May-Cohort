Practice of Data Structures and Algorithms
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Practice repository! The purpose of this project is to implement common algorithms on an advanced level with a particular attention to the exquisiteness of Python. Each solution is not only accurate but optimised for beauty, speed and understandability as well.

How to Run the Code

Reverse a String Using a Stack
In this solution, pythonâ€™s collections.deque is used as the stack to enhance performance of the implementation since all its push and pop operations will be constant time.


from collections import deque

def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:

    stack = deque(s)

    return ''.join([stack.pop() for _ in range(len(stack))])

Implement a Queue Using Two Stacks

This is an interesting implementation of queues using two stacks in such a manner as to hide all the associated logic and enforce the use of the type hints to allow usage of a maintainable and extensible design.

Find the Maximum Element in a List Using a Linked List

This peculiar implementation transforms a linked list into an iterable which allows usage of the max() function contained in Python, thus achieving high efficacy.

Testing

We test our solutions using pytest, which is a testing tool which is both simple and powerful for ensuring the integrity of our solutions. We check for edge cases and make sure that every solution is implemented correctly.
